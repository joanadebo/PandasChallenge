## Background for Roleplay

As the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. I be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I must aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance according to the following criteria:

### District Summary
Calculate the total number of unique schools 
Calculate the total number of students 
Calculate the total budget 
Calculate the average (mean) math score 
Calculate the average (mean) reading score 
Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading 

### School Summary 
Calculate the total student count 
Calculate the average test scores 
Calculate the number of schools with math scores of 70 or higher 
Calculate the number of schools with reading scores of 70 or higher 
Highest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
Lowest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing


### Math Scores by Grade 
Use the code provided to separate the data by grade 
Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each 


### Reading Scores by Grade 
Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each
Combine each of the scores above into single DataFrame called reading_scores_by_grade 
Scores by School Spending

### Scores by School Size 
Create the size_summary DataFrame using the binned and averaged size data

### Scores by School Type 
Group the per_school_summary DataFrame by "School Type" and average the results 
Create a new DataFrame called type_summary that uses the new column data
